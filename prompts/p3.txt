This is a puzzle. Create four groups of four. Words in each group fit under a specific category. Some categories might be defined by their use of wordplay (palindromes, homophones, adding or dropping letters and words) rather than the literal meanings of the words on the cards. Output them in the following format: four total lines. On each line, there should be four comma-separated items. No additional text (like group titles or descriptions) should be in the output. Also, there should not be anything in your output before or after the solution.
